# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! 
# We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is 
# Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

def get_name():
    """Returns the name as a string."""
    return "Sophia"  # The autograder expects this name

def main():
    print(f"Howdy {get_name()}! ðŸ¤ ")

# Run the main function
main()
# Note: The get_name function returns a string, and the main function prints a greeting using that name.
# You can change the name in the get_name function to test with different names.
