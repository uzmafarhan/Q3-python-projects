# Write a program which asks the user what their favorite animal is, and then always responds with "My favorite animal is also ___!" (the blank should be filled in with the user-inputted animal, of course).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics - note the space between the prompt and the user input!):

# What's your favorite animal? cow

# My favorite animal is also cow!

# Ask the user for their favorite animal and store the input in a variable
favorite_animal = input("What's your favorite animal? ")

# Print a response incorporating the user's input
print(f"My favorite animal is also {favorite_animal}!")\

# This program asks the user for their favorite animal and responds with a message including that animal.
# It demonstrates basic input and output operations in Python.
