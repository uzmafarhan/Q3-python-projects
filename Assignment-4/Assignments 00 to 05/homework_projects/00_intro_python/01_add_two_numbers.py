# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.


# Python program to take two integer inputs from the user and calculate their sum

# Prompt the user to enter the first number
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))  # Convert input to integer

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))  # Convert input to integer

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
total_sum = first_number + second_number

# Print the result with an appropriate message
print(f"The sum of {first_number} and {second_number} is: {total_sum}")
